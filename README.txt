This script loops through each record from a search in Telus Practice Solutions and adds a WHO BMI Growth Chart
to them. The search must be done separately for males and females. The title of the custom form for the Growth
Chart must be the only custom form that contains the words "BMI," "WHO," and "boys"/"girls." The first row in
the search window must be highlighted and the patient record window must be closed. If there is an error message
saying a patient must first be selected, simply open the first patient record and then close it again, then
re-run the script. If the script is stuck in the search window, open any other patient record, close it, then
click once on the first patient to highlight, then re-run the script.
